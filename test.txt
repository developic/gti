once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a young girl named alice. she was known for her curiosity and adventurous spirit.

alice spent her days exploring the woods near her home, where she would often find hidden paths and secret clearings. one sunny morning, she discovered a rabbit hole that seemed unusually deep.

curious as ever, alice decided to follow the rabbit down the hole. she slid down a long tunnel and landed in a strange room filled with doors of all sizes.

in this room, alice found a tiny key on a glass table. she tried it on the smallest door, but it was too big. then she noticed a bottle labeled "drink me" and decided to try it.

after drinking the potion, alice began to shrink until she was small enough to fit through the door. she entered a beautiful garden filled with flowers and talking animals.

in the garden, alice met a white rabbit who was always in a hurry. he told her about the queen of hearts and her croquet game. alice joined the game, which was quite chaotic.

during the game, alice encountered the queen, who was very bossy and quick to anger. the queen ordered her cards to paint the roses red, as they had grown white by mistake.

alice tried to help but ended up in an argument with the queen. she was put on trial for her actions, though she didn't understand what she had done wrong.

finally, alice woke up from her dream, back in the village. she realized that adventures could be found in the most unexpected places, and she never lost her sense of wonder.
